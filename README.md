# erfportfolio

This is a start to my portfolio.
I have demonstrated my ability to use html along with CSS to create a responsive webpage with basic style elements.

To build this website, I would like to cite google images for my avatar, mdn docs has helped along with css, and I have used pinterest to look up potential color schemes for css.
